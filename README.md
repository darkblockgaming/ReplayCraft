<b>ReplayCraft</b> is a powerful Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on that enables players to record and replay their in-game actions, similar to the popular ReplayMod for Java Edition. Whether you want to capture your best builds, or create cinematic replays, ReplayCraft makes it easy to record, play back, and analyze gameplay directly within Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

This branch is for the Bedrock Dedicated Server Software, it makes use of the server-net api to save the replay data to an external server and not filling up level.db which with multiple players and replays saved will crash the world. <b> There is no support for this version! </b>
