Here you will find the current slash commands for ReplayCraft and what they do. Note you no longer need to use the prefix `?` as we have moved over the Minecraft's custom slash commands. 

# ReplayCraft Sticks
You can use the `/controls` command to obtain the control items to control ReplayCraft, simply using this will display the Graphical User Interface for ReplayCraft.

# Skins
You can use the `/skin` command to set your preferred custom skin, model size and to enable the use of a cape or not for the playback entity. This is in place so that all players can set their skin even when ReplayCraft is being controlled by another player. 

!> All players need to set a skin other wise the default steve skin will be used in a multiplayer replay. 


# Pause
The custom command `/pause` allows you to pause the current recording.  

# Resume
The custom command `/resume` allows you to resume the current recording.  

# Load
This command allows you to quickly load the next x seconds of the recording this saves you going via the use to load part of the replay so you can then place a camera point. For example `/load 50` will load the next 50 seconds of the recording.

# Fly 
`/fly` puts the player into spectator mode for easier camera placement. This only works if you are in survival mode. It takes the current location you exectued the command to place you back once completed by adding a camera point.

# Add 
`/add` adds a camera point at the players current position and facing location.

# Multi Command Example
Some commands have been created to speed up the workflow of replaycraft while the UI is laid out for ease of use it can be tedious when you are working on a large recording one example is a timelapse. To easy the repetition you can use the following commands in a pattern.

- `/load 50` loads the next 50 seconds 
- `/fly` enables spectator mode when in survival allows the player to fly to the location they want to add a camera point.
- `/add` adds the camera point and places the player back to the starting location of `/fly`.
